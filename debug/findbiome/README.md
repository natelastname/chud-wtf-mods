# Minetest mod: findbiome

## Description
This is a mod to help with mod/game development for Minetest.
It adds a command (“findbiome”) to find a biome nearby and teleport you to it
and another command (“listbiomes”) to list biomes.

Version: 1.0.1

## Known limitations
There's no guarantee you will always find the biome, even if it exists in the world.
This can happen if the biome is very obscure or small, but usually you should be
able to find the biome.

If the biome could not be found, just move to somewhere else and try again.
