# Nate's CTF guns

This mod combines the best parts of the guns from [Capture the Flag](https://github.com/MT-CTF/capturetheflag) by rubenwardy and Lone_Wolf with the best parts of davidthecreator's [rangedweapons](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=15173) to create a gun mod for Minetest that is usable on both PVP servers and survival worlds.

Also includes the "darkness_nerf" mod from capture the flag that makes players and item entities more visible in the dark.
