# Base Gameplay Modpack
### by karlexceed

This is a modpack that combines several other gameplay mods that I consider useful for Minetest worlds.

It combines:
- Hunger with HUD bar by Wuzzy (hbhunger)
  - https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/hbhunger/
- HUD bars by Wuzzy (hudbars)
  - https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/hudbars/
- Illumination by Piezo_ (illumination)
  - https://content.minetest.net/packages/Piezo_/illumination/
- Tool Ranks by lisacvuk (toolranks)
  - https://content.minetest.net/packages/lisacvuk/toolranks/
- Unified Inventory by RealBadAngel (unified_inventory)
  - https://content.minetest.net/packages/RealBadAngel/unified_inventory/

### Recommends
Nothing in particular.

### Conflicts

### Software Requirements
This modpack has not been tested with many different versions of Minetest, but it is intended for use with a relatively recent version.  It is unlikely to work with old versions.
