# playerfactions

A simple mod which allows player created factions. Not very useful on its own,
it becomes very powerful when combined with other mods.

## Usage

By default players can only be in one faction at a time. If you want to allow
players to join multiple factions at once, add
`player_factions.mode_unique_faction = false` to minetest.conf.

Parameters marked with square brackets ([]) are optional; most of these are only
used if `mode_unique_faction` is false.

These commands can be used by anyone:

- `/factions create <faction> <password>`: Create a new faction
- `/factions list`: List available factions
- `/factions info <faction>`: See information on a faction. For faction with lot
  of member we can choose the length of the member's list that's going to be
  shown by adding `player_factions.max_members_list = int` to minetest.conf,
  the default is 50.
- `/factions player_info <player>` See information on a player : joined, owned
  and administered factions.
- `/factions join <faction> <password>`: Join an existing faction
- `/factions leave [faction]`: Leave your faction

These commands can only be used by faction owners and players with the
`playerfactions_admin` privilege:

- `/factions kick <player> [faction]`: Kick someone from your faction
- `/factions disband <password> [faction]`: Disband your faction
- `/factions passwd <password> [faction]`: Change your faction's password
- `/factions chown <player> <password> [faction]`: Transfer ownership of your
  faction.

This command can only be used by players with the `playerfactions_admin`
privilege:

- `/factions invite <player> <faction>`: Add player to a faction

### Using `playerfactions` in your own mod

I strongly recommend reading through the `init.lua` file; the functions at the
top give you a pretty good idea of how to use it, but just in case you're short
on time I'll list the most important functions below.

- `factions.version` is a variable made to check the version of the
  playerfactions mod to assert compatibility.
	- factions.version == nil for first version of playerfactions mod.
	- factions.version == 2 is the first time this variable is added, with
	  adding multi-faction mode.
- `player_is_in_faction(fname, player_name)`: `true` if the player is in the
   faction, `nil` in other cases (faction or player doesn't exists or player is
   not a member of the faction)
- `get_facts()`: Get a copied table with all data. The structure is :
```
{["name_of_faction1"]={
      ["owner"]=name_of_the_owner,
      ["members"]={["name_of_a_member1"]=true, ["name_of_a_member2"]=true}
  }}
```
- `get_player_faction(player)`: Get a string with the faction a player belongs
   to, `nil` if they haven't joined a faction. In multi-faction mode, it will
   return the oldest created faction which player is into. (It's not necessarily
   the one they joined first. It checks the facts variable from the top.)
- `get_player_factions(player)`: Get a table with the faction(s) a player
   belongs to, `nil` if they haven't joined a faction. The structure is:
   `{name_of_faction1, name_of_faction2}`.
- `get_owned_factions(player)`: Get a table with the faction(s) owned by a
   player, `nil` if they have the ownership of no faction. The structure is:
   `{name_of_faction1, name_of_faction2}`.
- `get_owner(faction)`: Get the owner of a faction
- `chown(fname, owner)`: Change the owner of a faction
- `register_faction(faction, player, password)`: Create a new faction
- `disband_faction(faction)`: Disband a faction
- `get_password(faction)`: Gets a faction's password
- `set_password(faction, password)`: Sets a faction's password
- `join_faction(faction, player)`: Sets the given player as belonging to this
   faction
- `leave_faction(faction, player)`: Remove the given player from the specified
   faction

Note that all of these functions have sanity checks: If a faction or player does
not exists, it return false. If the operation succeeds, it returns true or the
needed value.
